Buddhism can be confusing to begin with, especially if you come from a Christian, Islamitic or Jewish background. You may be unfamiliar with concepts such as karma, rebirth, 'emptiness' and the practice of meditation. On top of that, the presentation of Buddhism in the various traditions can vary quite a bit, so if you read materials from different traditions, it is easy to lose track.
The idea behind this website is to introduce the most important basics, as well as provide links for further study. It is important to realise that it takes some time and effort to get a grip on all these subjects, and to understand how they fit together. Buddhism is like a combination of philosophy, religion, psychology and mental training - a vast area to cover.
As proven over the centuries, the best way to digest the teachings would be to listen to teachings or read on a subject, and to spend some time pondering over it before continuing to the next subject, because unlike an academic study, all the subjects have direct implications for our own lives. Study, reflection and meditation are essential, as we need to check if these teachings are relevant to us. Buddhism should not be accepted on the basis of blind faith, but rather because we find it sensible.  The Buddha put it this way: "Only when it agrees with your experience and reason, and when it is conducive to the good and gain of oneself and all others, then one should accept the teachings, and live up to them". (Free from the Kalama Sutra.)  This will take time, so be a bit patient with yourself if you go through a period where everything you read just seems to provoke more questions; that is a really good sign! Most people take many months or years before gradually the whole 'puzzle of Buddhism' begins to fit together.
